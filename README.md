# Assignment 5

This project is an implementation of a Scheme-like interpreter in the language TypeScript.

## Dependencies

This project requires [TypeScript](typescriptlang.org).

## How to Run

Compile to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler ```tsc```. The compiler options contained in ```tsconfig.json``` are enough for use right now, so just running ```tsc``` is enough.

To run the JavaScript code, you can use any JS engine you like, including [Node](nodejs.org), or a browser-based engine like [V8](v8.dev]).
